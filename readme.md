# Portfolio
This is my COMM5961 final project, a non-linear portfolio website inspired by the game [her story](://www.herstorygame.com/about/).

The live version is hosted on [pantheon](://dev-comm5961-hu-portfolio.pantheonsite.io/portfolio/).

For Prof. Bernard:

Just type "Hi, I'm bernard!" or something like that in the search box to access to drupal, google analytics, etc. Thank you and have a nice holiday!
